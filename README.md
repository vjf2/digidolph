# digidolph
Spatially explicit null association model for dolphin data

This code can be used to re-create the analysis in Strickland et al. (in press). The model is inspired by and built upon the R package Digiroo2 with expansions for data collected under various sampling protocols. The product is simulated association matrices for indiviuals based on a set of re-locations for each individual.

The code utilizes the following R packages. See sessionInfo for most recent versions and platform tested.
